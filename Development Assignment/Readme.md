# Student Information System (SIS) & Academic Scheduling System (ACSS)

## Overview

This project consists of two interconnected systems: a **Student Information System (SIS)** and an **Academic Scheduling System (ACSS)**. The SIS is designed to manage student data, including registrations, courses, and enrollments. The ACSS handles room scheduling, class timings, and course management. 

The two systems are capable of integration, allowing for seamless data sharing between them.

## Features

### Student Information System (SIS)
- User registration and authentication
- Manage student data (add, view students)
- Course management (add, view courses)
- Enrollment management (add, view enrollments)
- Schedule management (add, view schedules)
- XML import feature for schedules

### Academic Scheduling System (ACSS)
- User registration and authentication
- Room management (add, view rooms)
- Schedule management (add, view schedules)
- Export schedules to XML
- Enrollment management (add, view enrollments)
- Import enrollments from JSON

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize (for ORM)
- MySQL (as the database)
- JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- xml2js for XML handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (v5.7 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Set Up the SIS**

   - Navigate to the SIS directory:
   ```bash
   cd sis
   ```

   - Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   - Create a MySQL database named `sis_db`.

   - Update the `sis/models/index.js` file with your MySQL credentials:
   ```javascript
   const sequelize = new Sequelize('sis_db', 'your_username', 'your_password', {
       host: 'localhost',
       dialect: 'mysql'
   });
   ```

   - Start the SIS server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Set Up the ACSS**

   - Open a new terminal and navigate to the ACSS directory:
   ```bash
   cd acss
   ```

   - Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   - Create a MySQL database named `acss_db`.

   - Update the `acss/models/index.js` file with your MySQL credentials:
   ```javascript
   const sequelize = new Sequelize('acss_db', 'your_username', 'your_password', {
       host: 'localhost',
       dialect: 'mysql'
   });
   ```

   - Start the ACSS server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Set Up the Integration Service**

   - Open a new terminal and navigate to the integration directory:
   ```bash
   cd integration
   ```

   - Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   - Update the `integration/integration.js` file if necessary to match your username and password.

   - The integration script can be run after both servers are running.

## Usage

### SIS API Endpoints

- **Auth**
  - `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate a user and receive a token.

  - `GET /students`: Get a list of students.

- **Courses**
  - `POST /courses`: Create a new course.
  - `GET /courses`: Get a list of courses.

- **Enrollments**
  - `POST /enrollments`: Enroll a student in a course.
  - `GET /enrollments`: Get a list of enrollments.
  - `GET /enrollments/course/:courseId`: Get enrollments for a specific course.

- **Schedules**
  - `POST /schedules`: Create a new schedule.
  - `GET /schedules`: Get a list of schedules.
  - `POST /schedules/import`: Import schedules from XML.

### ACSS API Endpoints

  - `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate a user and receive a token.

- **Rooms**
  - `POST /rooms`: Create a new room.
  - `GET /rooms`: Get a list of rooms.

- **Schedules**

  - `GET /enrollments`: Get a list of enrollments.
  - `POST /enrollments/import`: Import enrollments from JSON.

### Integration

You can integrate SIS and ACSS using the integration service:
- Use the `integration/integration.js` file to send enrollment data from SIS to ACSS.

## Testing

You can test the APIs using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [cURL](https://curl.se/).

### Example Requests

#### Register a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "test_user", "password": "password123"}'
```

#### Login a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "test_user", "password": "password123"}'
```

#### Create a Student

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/students -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com", "dob": "2000-01-01", "programEnrolled": "Computer Science"}'
```
